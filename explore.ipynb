    "    # By far the easiest approach.\n",

    "D. Add extra columns\n",
    "    # Most accurate, but will mess with any ML algo if not weighted properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Issue #2: Keywords Overlap with Creature Names (Death's Shadow, Flying Men)\n",
    "This is mostly fine. For one thing, many of these cards match color identity with their mechanic (Flying men are blue, DS is black, etc.)\n",
    "We could look into some kind of way to differentiate based on regex or pattern matching, but let's leave that for now.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Issue 3: The word Counter\n",
    "So, despite being able to name things whatever they want, and repeated oracle changes to simplify and clarify wording, MTG still uses the word 'counter' to mean two different things: a keyword action meaning \"Remove this spell or ability from the stack\", and a board object placed on permanents i.e. +1/+1 counters, loyalty counters. Countering things (first interpretation) is a blue-coded mechanic, while counters (second interpretation) are a fairly universal mechanic, maybe leaning white and green but with no real identity. Again, we could look into differentiating these by string matching (\"counter target\" vs \"+1/+1 counter\"), but since counters don't really have an identity, we're changing \"counter\" in keyword abilities to \"counter target\". There are also way too many strings about the other kind of counter to simply process (counter vs counters, etc.). This does remove Baral, the bluest creature ever, from the counter keyword column, but whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Issue 4: Parsing Card Names\n",
    "This might be an entirely different ML task. There are packages to determine semantic vectors of words. Use the names of each card (sum of all word vectors) as a feature set. A card like Death's Shadow would be easy peasy. Brushwagg, on the other hand, maybe not. Proper names like Olivia Voldaren, or worse, Drizz't Dourden, would be all but impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Issue 5: Improving Performance\n",
    "Current accuracy for testing dataset sits at about 64%- not great for a binary classifier, but pretty good for a classifier with 6 classes (chance rate of 17%). Let's try running a binary classifier on enemy-colors cards, say blue and green (probably the most disparate colors in terms of creatures)."
