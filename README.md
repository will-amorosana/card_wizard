# card_wizard
Data Science and ML experiments on MTG data


My goals for this project were as follows:
- Do some ML modelling and refresh myself on the libraries I haven't touched since uni.
- See how usable the MTG card data was
- Try and see how to model card properties as features, especially the more qualitative properties like creature types and keyword abilities.
