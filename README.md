# card_wizard
Data Science and ML experiments on MTG data


My goals for this project were as follows:
- Do some ML modelling and refresh myself on the libraries I haven't touched since uni.
- See how usable the MTG card data was
- Try and see how to model card properties as features, especially the more qualitative properties like creature types and keyword abilities.


Future Goals
- Semantic Modelling! Use semantic vectors trained on the text of each card to further model color identity. This could be a way to train on instants and sorceries (who have less numerical data associated with them).
- Vision! Been a while since I touched vision, but would be fun to look at vision libraries and try to scan an image for text.
- Turn this into a chatbot! You tell it facts about a card, and it tries to guess the card. Like Akinator, but for MTG. That would be a much larger project.
